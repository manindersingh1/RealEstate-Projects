                            <h1>Major MISTAKES IN COMMON HOME BUYERS MAKE.</h1>

                            <h2>#1 Not knowing what they can afford before making an offer.</h2>
                            <p>
                                The best way to avoid this is to get pre-approved for a mortgage so you
                            know exactly how much you can afford. Usually pre-approvals are free.
                            </p>

                            <h2>#2 not knowing who the agent represents.</h2>
                            <p>
                                Unless an agent is working as your buyer representative, they represent the
                            seller. Many people don't realize this.
                            </p>

                            <h2>#3 choosing the wrong mortgage.</h2>
                            <p>
                                A bad mortgage can cost you thousands in taxes and interest. Consult an
                            accountant before you choose your mortgage.
                            </p>

                            <h2>#4 Not finding problems with the home before buying it.</h2>
                            <p>
                                You should always have a professional inspector look at the home before
                            buying it, otherwise you could be looking at huge repair costs later on.
                            Read this guide to avoiding a money pit.
                            </p>

                            <h2>#5 Not understanding how their credit can impact their ability to purchase
                            or refinance a home.</h2>

                            <p>
                                Get a mortgage professional to help you go over and prepare your credit
                            file before you buy a home.

                            <h2>*HOW TO AVOID A MONEY PIT: BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THESE 6 WARNING SIGNS THAT
                            COULD MEAN EXPENSIVE REPAIRS...*</h2>
                            Many people think that serious defects in a home are easy to spot, but the
                            truth is, often the most serious and costly problems can only be detected
                            upon very close inspection. When you are considering buying a home, look
                            for the following six telltale signs of serious problems...
                        <h2>*1. Roof*</h2>
                            <p>
                                Leaks are the most common problem with roofs, and are tough to detect from
                            outside. However, from inside an attic, you can often see water marks where
                            there is a leak.
                            </p>
                            <h2>*2. Plumbing System*</h2>
                            <p>
                                Make sure you are confident that both water systems: the one that brings
                            fresh water in and the one that takes sewage out are functioning well
                            before signing on the dotted line.
                            </p>
                            <h2>*3. Electrical Systems*</h2>
                            <p>
                                Before you agree to buy you should make sure that you can run all of the
                            appliances you want to and even power tools at the same time without having
                            a power failure. You also want to make sure that the electrical system is
                            safe and does not present a fire hazard.
                            </p>
                            <h2>*4. Heating and Cooling Systems*</h2>
                            <p>
                                Be sure to thoroughly inspect the heating and air conditioning systems in
                            any home you are considering purchasing.
                            </p>
                            <h2>*5. Bad Paint and Signs of Rotting*</h2>
                            <p>
                                The paint inside and outside the house can reveal a lot about the condition
                            of the underlying material. Check several places on several walls, using
                            your eyes and a screwdriver for poking.
                            </p>
                            <h2>*6. Cracks and other important signs*</h2>
                            <p>
                                Cracks in walls, doors not closing properly and uneven floors can all be
                            signs that there is a problem with the foundation. If the foundation is not
                            strong, the entire house could literally collapse, so you should carefully
                            check for these signs. A bad foundation may not mean imminent disaster, but
                            it could be used to bargain for a lower sale price, or you could ask to
                            have the owner repair it before the sale.
